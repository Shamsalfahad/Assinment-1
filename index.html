           <p>Your team can confidently train and support youth-facing professionals. For leaders & professional trainers who support youth-focused programs. You’re tired of second-guessing if your professional development efforts are meeting the mark.  You’re ready to build the professional learning your people need in order to be effective with young people. 

            Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your funders and partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have the knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation.
            
            Without a clear system of high-quality training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not sustain.  Great staff could leave. Your program won’t reach as many young people as it could.</p>

        <div class="half-width">  <h1>Grow Your Global Community</h1>
            <h1><span class="orange">About Community</span> </h1> 
             
             <p>If you can’t find the community you wish existed, create it.

                Two years ago, I started Side Project Sessions in Melbourne because I knew how beneficial passion projects can be for your sense of wellbeing and career, but also how challenging they are to prioritize. The event took off almost instantly. People identified with the problem of creative work falling to the bottom of their to-do list, and felt that having time, space and quiet could provide an antidote. Within a few months of launching, I received multiple emails from people wanting to bring the sessions to their city.
                
                The prospect of bringing my event to a global audience was exciting, but I soon discovered that creating an event because I wanted it to exist for my own community was very different from running the growth of an international branded event series.
                
                In expanding Side Project Sessions I’ve experimented a lot and made plenty of mistakes while I grapple with questions like, “How do you find a sustainable model both as a creator and for a community? How do you maintain consistency as something expands? And how do you make space for things evolve, especially in a virtual space?”
                
                But I’ve also experienced many rewarding surprises. During the process of figuring it all out, I looked to other global communities for advice and insights, including CreativeMornings, Ladies Wine Design, Silent Book Club, and the Bullet Journal. This guide will be ideal for someone who has already formed a community around an event series or method, and is now in the process of figuring out how to expand to other locations while keeping it sustainable. The guide explores the pros and cons of going global with your event, various models for expanding your community, how to get the right people on board, ensuring consistency, and learning to evolve and let go.
